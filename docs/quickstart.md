# Quickstart

## Integration ðŸ’»

    === "Downloading"
    
        You can copy the script from our repository in [`cmake/FetchBoostContent.cmake`](https://github.com/alandefreitas/FetchBoostContent/blob/master/cmake/FetchBoostContent.cmake) or the [release page](https://github.com/alandefreitas/FetchBoostContent/releases), and include it in your project.

        ```cmake
        include(cmake/FetchBoostContent.cmake)
        ```

    === "Download with CMake"

        When FetchContent is not going to be the main strategy for integrating Boost, a second alternative is to use CMake itself to [download the script file](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/file.html#download) and include it only when needed.

        ```cmake
        if (USE_FETCH_CONTENT)
            set(url https://github.com/alandefreitas/FetchBoostContent/blob/master/cmake/FetchBoostContent.cmake)
            set(destination ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/cmake/FetchBoostContent.cmake})
            if (NOT EXISTS destination)
                file(DOWNLOAD ${url} ${destination})
            endif()
            include(${destination})
        endif()
        ```

        This strategy might also be useful to keep the script up-to-date.
